**Current state**
- *3D Renderer*: Fully supported 3D rendering with clustered forward rendering for optimal performance.
- *Material Editor*: Intuitive material editor for creating and tweaking materials.
- *Scripting*: Built-in scripting support using AngelScript for creating game logic.
- *Asset Manager*: Robust asset manager for handling textures, models, and other game assets.
- *Sound System*: Comprehensive sound system for creating immersive audio experiences.
- *Runtime*: Supports runtime loading and unloading of assets, scripts, and other game data.

**Whats to come**
I want the engine to support a layer system where all scenes can be layered on top of each other making it more modular.
