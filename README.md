**Current state**
The current state of this game engine reflects its early developmental phase, with ongoing refinement anticipated. 
This endeavor serves primarily as an educational journey for myself. The engine boasts support for an Entity-Component-System (ECS), 
Renderer, scene management functionality, and comprehensive 3D model importing capabilities. In the event of malfunctions, 
it's important to note that accountability does not rest solely upon my shoulders.

**Whats to come**
I want the engine to support a layer system where all scenes can be layered ontop of each other making it more modular.
