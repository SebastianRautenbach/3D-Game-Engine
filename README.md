**Current state**
The engine is still in it's very early state but it is "functional". The engine does feature a component based entity system similar to Unity and Unreal. The engine has a basic renderer capable to render 3D and lighting.

**Inprogress**
I am busy with the asset management system allowing for more efficient memory allocation and a dynamic garbage collector.

**Whats to come**
I want the engine to support a layer system where all scenes can be layered ontop of each other making it more modular.
